# SingleLinkedList
Single linked list application is a C# .Net 5.0 console application that utilizes simple data structures to create a node that
is a head and adds up all of the data in each tail of the node via an iterative for loop. The for loop offers a complexity of O(N). To decrease complexity to O(1) for
performance would require removal of any items in the single linked list that was not applicable to the current set of operations. Removing everything except for 
the head and tail would allow for a search complexity of O(1) for either a stack or queue, respectfully.
